# La Esquinita - Sugar-Laced Parable About Power

## 🎨 Project Overview

**La Esquinita** is the debut solo exhibition by Miami-based artist Tara Long at Locust Projects (November 2025 - January 2026). This digital experience serves as both a companion to and extension of the physical installation, exploring Miami's cycles of exploitation from "Big Sugar" to Big Tech.

### Core Concept
A 2,500 sq ft walk-through installation that juxtaposes Florida's early 20th-century "Big Sugar" land grab with today's influx of Big Tech capital, showing how both sweeten—and hollow—local culture. The materials oscillate between confectionery fantasy and rot: fondant-like plaster, glossy ceramic "snacks," cracked stucco, and projected spores.

- **Theme**: Sugar-coated critique of power and consumption
- **Aesthetic**: Confectionery fantasy vs. decay, sugar sculptures vs. cracked stucco
