# La Esquinita - Sugar-Laced Parable About Power

## 🎨 Project Overview

**La Esquinita** is the debut solo exhibition by Miami-based artist Tara Long at Locust Projects (November 2025 - January 2026). This digital experience serves as both a companion to and extension of the physical installation, exploring Miami's cycles of exploitation from "Big Sugar" to Big Tech.

### Core Concept
A 2,500 sq ft walk-through installation that juxtaposes Florida's early 20th-century "Big Sugar" land grab with today's influx of Big Tech capital, showing how both sweeten—and hollow—local culture. The materials oscillate between confectionery fantasy and rot: fondant-like plaster, glossy ceramic "snacks," cracked stucco, and projected spores.

### Brand Identity
- **Logo**: [La Esquinita Logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/dck5rzi4h/image/upload/v1753892032/la-esquinita/LE-logo-tara_jdjyo9.png)
- **Alternative Logo**: [La Esquinita Logo 2](https://res.cloudinary.com/dck5rzi4h/image/upload/v1753892200/la-esquinita/LE-logo-tara-2_aurodr.png)
- **Theme**: Sugar-coated critique of power and consumption
- **Aesthetic**: Confectionery fantasy vs. decay, sugar sculptures vs. cracked stucco

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Inventory Naming Rules (Custom Storefront)
- Source photos live in `public/La_Esquinita_Inventory/` and follow `{number}_{label}_{variant}.jpg`.
- Display text is always `No. {number}` (unpadded), while slugs use zero-padded numbers plus kebab-case labels (`021-parrot`).
- `_1` images are the hero beauty shot, `_2` shows the underside/number, `_3+` append to the gallery if ever present.
- Titles/alt text auto-derive from the filename label (with optional overrides), and metadata such as pricing/categories comes from a simple lookup table.
- Full details live in `docs/inventory-playbook.md` and power the 250-item storefront rollout.
- Supabase schema updates for these objects live in `docs/supabase-inventory-migration.sql`.

### Square Checkout Configuration
- `.env.local` needs `SQUARE_ENV`, `SQUARE_SANDBOX_ID`, `SQUARE_PROD_ID`, `SQUARE_SANDBOX_TOKEN`, `SQUARE_PROD_TOKEN`, and `LOCATION_ID`.
- Web checkout pulls `/api/square/config` for the public IDs and posts to `/api/checkout/square`.
- Webhook verification requires `SQUARE_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY` and `SQUARE_WEBHOOK_NOTIFICATION_URL` set to the exact URL you register inside Square’s dashboard.
